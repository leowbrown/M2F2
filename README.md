## Statements

- End Each line with a ';'.
- When separated by semicolons, multiple short statements on one line are allowed.
- Allow one " " before and after operators
- Correct Use of indention.

  #### Good Example:

                  function myFunction() {
                      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
                  }


## Variables

- Variable naming to be in camel casing.

    eg.  thisIsMyFunction

- Variable names should be relevant and descriptive.
- When possible, Variables will be given a value on the same line of declaration.
- Variables will be declared at the beginning of the script/function.

## Comments

- Each block of code will have a comment addressing the function it provides.
- Unrelating comments will be removed before publishing.
- Comments will have a line break above and bellow to allow breathing room.

## Conditional

- If Statements will have a space after to allow breathing room, the condition will be indented from the "if" and the closing curly brace will have its own line

  #### Bad Example:    
                  if(hour < 18){
                  greeting = "Good day";}


  #### Good Example:    
                  if (hour < 18) {
                    greeting = "Good day";
                  }


- If more than 3 possible statements are made, Use the Switch Statement.
